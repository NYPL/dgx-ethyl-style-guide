## SC5 style guide generator

> Style guide generator is a handy little tool that helps you generate good looking style guides from style sheets using KSS notation. It can be used as a command line utility, gulp task or Grunt task (needs grunt-gulp) with minimal effort. More info: [https://github.com/SC5/sc5-styleguide].

**Useful commands:**

*   `gulp watch`      - to build the styleguide and watch for file changes (auto-build).
*   `gulp styleguide` - to build the styleguide.
